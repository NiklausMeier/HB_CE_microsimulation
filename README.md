# Haemophilia B CE Microsimulation

## Description





## Installation
These files can be downladed and then run by a suitable version of R. The model was mainly developed in R 4.2.1 but should be compatible with future version, as long as the required packages do not change.
The following packages (and their dependencies) are required: ggplot2, RColorBrewer, pander, data.table, lookup, truncnorm, ggpubr, plyr, ggrepel, captioner, rmarkdown
These packages are installed and loaded in automatically when running the '00_master_file.R' script.
