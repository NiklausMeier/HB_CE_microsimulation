#' This function helps to check whether the models/patients are converging to
#' stable values. It should be used with the combined results
#' of the simulations/patients.

#' Inputs:

#' 1. results_combined from fun_results, either of patients or of simulations.

#' 2. Interval within which to check for convergence (5 models, 10 patients, etc.)
#' When the number of simulations/patients is divided by this number, it must lead to a whole number, not a fraction.
#' GOOD: 500 patients and interval of 100. 500 / 100 = 5 (whole number)
#' BAD: 500 patients and interval of 200. 500 / 200 = 2.5 (not whole number)

#' 3. Percentage within which cumulative mean should stay to count as converged.
#' The smaller this number, the stricter the criteria for convergence.
